This door seal is used in two-door fridges and therefore one door seal is required for each door.

Over time, the door seal can wear out, become cracked, or lose its elasticity. A faulty door seal will lead to increased energy consumption, inconsistent temperatures, and potential spoilage of food. To replace the door seal, simply peel off the old seal, and clean the sealing area. Align the new seal along the door perimeter and press it firmly into place to create a tight seal.

This filter is found in top-freezer and bottom-freezer refrigerators located in the back upper right corner. It measures 4.75-Inches deep, 9.5-Inches high, and 5.25-Inches wide. It is certified to reduce particles, chlorine-resistant cysts, lead and five other impurities. The pressure requirement is 40-120 PSI (if yours exceeds this, you?ll need to install a pressure-timing valve), and the operating temperature needs to be 33-100 degrees Fahrenheit. It filters down to 0.5-1 microns. The installation is simple and does not require any tools or mess. To remove the old cartridge, turn it to the left and pull down carefully. Some water might drip, so keep a cloth handy. To install the new filter, place it into the cartridge holder and turn to the right until it will no longer turn. If you have a top-freezer model it should be situated vertically, and if it is a bottom-freezer model, it should be placed horizontally. Be careful not to over-tighten. If your model has a replacement indicator light, reset it by pushing and holding it down for three seconds.

If you notice that your doors open and the mullion either moves freely or is stuck, this hinge needs to be replaced immediately to prevent issues with frost buildup, energy efficiency and temperature fluctuations. Replacing this hinge is quite simple, and you will only need a flathead and Philips-head screwdriver to do it. First, remove the screw covers from the securing screws for the mullion. Unscrew and remove the securing screws with your Philips-head screwdriver, and then pull the mullion up and out carefully to dislodge it from the fridge door. Near the middle of the mullion, disconnect the wire harness to remove the mullion completely. Remove the hinge cover with a flathead screwdriver to expose the hinge, and then carefully remove and replace the old hinge onto its attaching spring. Then you can simply reassemble the rest of the door assembly, along with the hinge cover and wire harness.",,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxAnUxggv_Y,https://www.partselect.com/PS4143931-Samsung-DA61-03230B-Hinge.htm?SourceCode=18,4.6,5,refrigerator,Samsung,Samsung,In Stock,AP4141349

To replace this pump assembly, you will only need a Philips-head screwdriver, but should start by removing your dishwasher racks. Then, pull up on the lower spray arm, and drain trap to remove them. Next, rotate the spray arm support and pull that up to remove it, at which point you can remove the base and filter for the drain pump. With those out, you can use your Philips-head screwdriver to disconnect and remove the cover and drain pump assembly.
