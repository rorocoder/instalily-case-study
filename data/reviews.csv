Simple to screw on and hook up after everything was out of the way. Difficult part was figuring out what wasn’t working. Initially it was a part that was known to fail that caused overflow of water into the bottom of the freezer floor where it froze and then overflowed onto the floor. Then it was the back drain that froze up and had to be thawed out and cleaned out. Next it was trying to figure out why the ice maker stopped working after the overflow problem was fixed. Turned out the ice maker itself failed coincidentally at the same time the other stuff was being fixed. The part was shipped quickly and the installation wasn’t too painful.

PS8746522,38cd54d77caa5575,5,"Worked as expected, but not real easy to replace due to location of part","When I received the part I was worried it wouldn't work, as the start relay was configured differently than the one that came out of the fridge. But, I figured all I could do was try & if i failed then I could always call a repair person. When the fridge stopped working, I went to YTube and watched several videos on what could be wrong. Went ahead & removed the compressor start device and knew right away it was broken. Received the new one & put it in. Because of where the part was located and the cramped quarters in the fridge, it did take some effort to put the new one in. The most difficult part was putting the wire that holds the part in place back. I finally installed it backwards, hooked it on the top first then pushed the bottom portion into place. The fridge started up after I plugged it back in & It got cold within 24 hours.. AS I write this, it turned out this was part 1 of fixing this fridge. It did get cold but it actually got too cold. I ended up also replacing the damper, and now the fridge works great. Finally, the hardest part for me on this repair is: I am 66 yrs old woman & have a bad knee, getting down on the floor, I cushioned myself with an exercise mat, was not comfortable, but I did it and saved myself some $$$ by doing it myself.

I almost also picked the second highest percentage part to save on shipping, but decided to trust the recommended part by Instant Repairman. The actual installation only took about 10 minutes. The moving of the freezer to get access, and defrosting of the frozen water that has accumulated made it into a 60 minute partially active job. The video provided was pretty accurate and I felt it took longer to watch the video than to do the the repair (stopping and starting the video included). Now, everything is working perfectly, I salvaged a 16 year old fridge, spent less than $27 and I am very satisfied with the whole process.

I read the directions when I was made aware that the ice maker was shipped. And when it arrived I installed the ice maker.

The adjustment of the water tube was a little confusing, but all I had to do was pull it out enough for the water to fill the tray. We now have ice and the maker is working just fine.

PS17917059,b7e65e42dfab6a74,4,Blessed!,"I ordered a ice maker. The new refrigerator was installed in November. I was told it would take 4 months to even order the ice maker. So, I went online and searched until I found the correct part for the fridge. It still took 4 months to arrive and I still think I made the right decision to order from EASY. I read the directions when I was made aware that the ice maker was shipped. And when it arrived I installed the ice maker. I have been accustomed to having a ice maker for years and I was determined to put it in. The adjustment of the water tube was a little confusing, but all I had to do was pull it out enough for the water to fill the tray. We now have ice and the maker is working just fine. Because of the model of the fridge, the ice maker is smaller than what I had before and it is working well. I am not disappointed with my decision to purchase this way.

If the fridge was not in use (i.e. empty) I would have removed the doors. I left the fridge running and covered the fresh food section opening with a large piece of cardboard I got at the grocery store - found a big cardboard sheet from a pallet of water bottles. Used some masking tape to hold the cardboard cover in place. I suppose you could do without the cardboard cover as food wont spoil in the ~20 mins needed to do gasket replacement. Emptied the door compartments and removed the shelving parts (washed the parts). Removed door panel and replaced gasket - would have been easier with a helper to hold things up, but I did if by myself. Only issue was at bottom of door - the large, thin gasket lip was sagging and interfering with door jamb. Loosened screws to stretch gasket out a bit. Used 3 bits of masking tape to hold up the gasket lip so door closes properly (remove tape after gasket settles into place).",Robert O,"March 31, 2020",True

When the last one broke, I was so upset because I had to put all of the stuff like pickles and dressings on another shelf. When the old shelf failed, everything fell on the floor making a big mess. I looked into replacing the shelf only to find out the part was discontinued. I thought I would never find a replacement. However much to my delight the original part was replaced with a different part. I was apprehensive at first because I wasnt sure if this new part would fit my door. I almost decided to just not order a new shelf. To just live with the way my ranch dressing and jelly were haphazardly placed in random places on other shelves. Your website assured me that the part would fit and soothed my fears. I went and threw caution to the wind and took a chance by ordering this new part number. Several days later I recieved the part ordered and apprehensively opened the door to my fridge, afraid I had been deceived by the great internet. Much to my delight it was a perfect fit for the door. I quickly removed all the items that had fallen to the floor when the original shelf broke and replaced them in their rightful place.

The new one fit perfectly - although I did have to take it off once to make sure the water line was tucked into the top of the icemaker. After reconnecting the power and the water line at the wall, off it went. It filled immediately, and shortly after that I had ice. A couple weeks later, everything is still working perfectly.

Two repairmen didn't want to touch the problem. I'd already changed the water tube (that they didn't want to either), so I figured I'd take a look around at the water dispenser lever that wasn't returning and therefore wasn't shutting off the water. We'd been having to pull the lever back by hand. Like I said, two different repairmen acted like it was experimental brain surgery to fix it. I took a good look, saw that one of the tines on our levers retaining/clip was broken (the one that brings the water lever back, obviously), found it on PartSelect, ordered it, and put it in. It wasn't the easiest job in the world, but it wasn't the hardest either. Why these repairmen were afraid of it baffles me. Aren't the supposed to have the know-how? Anyway, I replaced the clip, and the lever comes back to the proper place, shuts off like it's supposed to, and we're happy as hell!",Vince M,"December 18, 2019",True

As an aside, this repair was a process of elimination. I repaired my water line, which was always a problem. After I fixed the water line, the water flowed great from the dispenser, but the ice maker was still not producing ice.

PS991485,e2d92fb9448747a3,5,Did the trick and then some.,"Well my thermostat was going out. This particular fridge has a history of thermostats and relays and starters. Had it fixed under warranty once. Kenmore twice. They have a great program for those not confident in diy. Didn't buy it from them either. Anyhow replaced thermostat and defrost timer about 5 to six years ago myself with parts and instructions from Parts Select. This time around I knew what was up and were to order parts. Ordered a thermostat and defrost timer. There both close together so I do them both. Did the thermostat first, fired it up and on she came. Then did the timer. I want to add for anyone doing the defrost timer. When you first turn your unit back on it may take up to ten minutes or so to kick on. Reason being I believe is your timer might be in a defrost cycle. I had that happen both times to me. Another issue I had was when the fridge kicked on it was really dimming the lights including messing with my window AC units. Also you could hear the starter clicking quite hard. Went ahead and ordered a starter and relay. Didn't have to much in guidance other then find the compressor. There attached to it. Pulled the bottom back panel and there sat the compressor on the left side. Since it had been changed before the spade connections were fine. The starter and relay slide onto prongs coming out of the compressor body. Complete time involved maybe fifteen minutes. Though I did spend another thirty minutes with the vacuum cleaner on the cooling coils. Parts Select sent me 2 relays and starters. Depending on your fridges cubic feet will determine which ones to use. Now the only thing I hear from my 19 year old fridge is the hum of the cooling fan and compressor. Quiet as a mouse and no more blackouts when it kicks on. She still will hit 10 below in the freezer and keeps my fridge between 33 and 32 degrees. I keep it that cold because here in the south especially on weekends the fridge gets opened and closed a bunch. Even after an active day she still stays below 40.Thank you Parts Select.",Richard D,"May 6, 2019",True

Actual installation and reassembly was only an hour. YouTube is great - but it does not mention that the worst part is getting the ice to melt. Prior to removing the old parts you must melt the ice that formed on the coils because the old parts failed. Total operation using a heater and a heat gun required 6 hours to complete. This was the second time we performed this replacement since purchase of the appliance 10 years ago. Could it be that they may only last 5 years?

PS303933,2d4a107842269d98,5,"My refrigerator is ""Cool"" again!","When I noticed that my refrigerator never seemed to shut off, I found the usual condition that exists when the defrost coils stop auto-defrosting. The freezer was sill freezing, but the refrigerator was getting warmer inside. That indicates that a glacier has formed on the coils in the freezer and the fan can no longer push cold air over into refrigerator side because the ice is blocking the air flow. Removing the panel covering the freezer's coils confirmed my suspicion. So I ordered the replacement defroster ""kit"" from PS. I asked for expedited delivery and it came without any trouble. Once I had the parts, I proceeded to install them. PS's video instructions are excellent, but I would like to add that you may have to use a hand-held hair dryer to thaw the ""glacier"" out. Just put a pile of bath towels into the bottom of the freezer to catch the water as the drip pan will easily overflow if you don't. It takes a total of about 1 hour, including defrost time to do the job. PartSelect is a great resource",Roger S,"August 24, 2018",True

I had to remove the old one to allow the doors close as much as possible. Still, without the vertical mullion rail there's a gap between the doors where air can pass through, so I had to stuff paper towels as a temporary fix. We sprung for the expedited shipping, and that was an inspired choice...really glad we did. Received and installed the part less than 36 hours after ordering it. Installation took about 3 minutes.

PS11739021,d9be5a3d760d856d,1,Unnecessary when buying the pan,"I bought the trim at the same time that I bought the pan because the way that the parts are labeled on the drawing on the PartSelect website, I thought that the pan itself did not come with the trim. Then the trim arrived in the flat package with the shipping label for both items. I needed to pay PartSelect for a second meat pan (doubling down on the irony, as I am a vegan) while the company spent the next week or so processing the refund for the part that never arrived. I was charged a $10 fee for expedited shipping with the guarantee that this fee would be refunded when the order shipped. It was more convenient to do it this way, though had I simply re-ordered the meat pan myself and paid with Amazon Pay as I did the first time, it would have arrived a day sooner. And I would not have needed to call customer service yet again to say that the refund I was given was $3 and not the entire fee of $9.95 that was promised to be refunded. Waiting an extra day on an order that was never shipped or received and paying the extra money for this service did not make sense. On the positive side, the pan, when it did arrive, was just what I needed to replace a drawer that had long before broken in the refrigerator I gave to my parents due to their over-filling and weighing it down. It would have been nice not to need to pay for it twice to receive it once and not to be charged for delivery which was already overdue after the original shipment was covered through Amazon Pay. And it would have been nice to know that you don't buy the trim separately, that they sell the trim separately in case it breaks while the drawer remains intact. I should probably check to make sure all of the refunds went through. No idea why this company keeps offering me opportunities to explain how horrible they are. But I will take them up on the invitations every time.",Debbie S,"August 14, 2018",True

PS869316,1964dc4b126b3c47,5,"Easy repair, worked as advertised. Video instruction very helpful.","Previous owners had by-passed the water softener, ruining the reverse osmosis water filter supplying water to the refrigerator. This caused fouling and mineral deposits on the freeze tray and nearby components. Final failure appears to have been caused by corrosion of the ""U""-shaped heater element that heats up and causes release of the ice cubes, prior to their mechanical ejection by the geared timer motor. Complete disassembly revealed the geared timing motor, the cam-operated electrical contacts, and the normally-open (at room temperature) thermostatic switch were all functional. The only defect in the original ice maker assembly was the heater element. The new part was an exact match for the old part and was installed without difficulty. We had new ice within a few hours and a full ice bucket three days later. Re-installation only required re-using four hex-head, self-tapping, sheet-metal screws and a 1/4-inch hex-head socket driver.

PS869316,642e7c221e47638f,5,Relatively easy replacement,"The video that PartSelect shared that showed the repair person replacing the icemaker convinced me I could do the same. I had two issues: separating the electrical connector (it was really tightly held) and the water inlet tube hung up on me when reinstalling the new assembly.That tube has to be pushed up out of the way to allow the icemaker assembly to slide back in. Otherwise, I'm glad I tackled this project and now I have ice again! I can share a bit of advice: if your old icemaker still has ice in it (mine did) but didn't eject it before you decide to make this repair, I suggest wearing a glove while you try and support the assembly while disconnecting the electrical connector. My hand was so cold holding it that I had to set it down and start over.",Henry A,"February 12, 2018",True

I did flush the line with about two gallons of water until it ran clear and then re-started the ice machine and all worked well.

PS12741751,c10695ad0b978239,5,The right Parr for the repair,"On the morning of July 3rd, as I opened the refrigerator door of my 2 year old Whirlpool side-by-side the door came off as the pin in the hinge popped out. I was able to pop the pin in but it kept popping out. So I called Parts Select. The representative did a great job of choosing the correct part. And I paid an extra shipping fee but the part still took 2 weeks to arrive at my door. Then I found that I needed special tools to install the part. Meanwhile thevpin kept popping out. So I had to hold the pin down with my right hand as I opened or closed the door with my right hand. Of my 2 year-old fridge. Then I spent an hour at my Local Lowes where I had purchased the fridge to replace my 5 year old Samsung. In June 2023bi bought an extended warranty but the salesperson had not provided the paperwork with my warranty number and I didn't notice until I needed this part installed. So I finally had the part that I bought and a date for the part to be installed. And the repair person told me that they have to replace these hinges all the time. So Parts Select dud a great job. But the shipping company wasn't worth the extra cost. And it appears that Whirlpool appliances are no longer reliable no matter how much they cost. I recommend Parts Select when you need something. They are great.",Pam W,"August 4, 2023",True

PS11743369,3fc7067ff237732e,5,Part fits fine. Working well. But ...,"Removing the old clamps and installing the new ones was the most difficult part of swapping out my Whirlpool dryer motor. More of a pain than cutting off the old blower wheel with a Dremel. Tore-up one clamp trying to remove it. I was unable to get the screw driver removal and install techniques shown on the video (and other videos on the internet) to work. Motor clamps didn't want to come off the failed motor or go on the replacement motor. Ended up slip forcing/pushing them on from the side after hooking them on either end first. I would suggest on your video telling folks if they're looking to replace a dryer motor, they are probably dealing with a 20+ year old machine. Check on Mod. No. label or manufacturer's website for build date. If you're dealing with a machine that old purchase a blower wheel and a couple of motor clamps along with the motor. Don't even bother with the effort and cussing necessary to round off the blower wheel plastic nut with a 13/16 wrench, adjustable wrench or Vice Grips. Immediately remove the back of the dryer and the plumbing to expose the wheel and cut it off with a Dremel. My Whirlpool had to be tilted forward from behind to snake out the plumbing. Wouldn't suggest using a chisel unless it's a sharp one. Would take a lot of effort chiseling a hole in the center of the blower wheel which is molded from a of pretty stout piece of plastic. Despite the difference between the wiring of the failed and replacements motors, have faith. Follow the instructions provided with the new motor and it’ll all work out in the end. Hint, do not lose the two 1/8” wire blades provided. You’ll more than likely need them. Have a heat gun or hair dryer at the ready to heat the shrink wrap. Hints for more humanely removing and installing the motor clamps? I have no idea. Disappointed, but not surprised, my genuine Whirlpool dryer motor was made in Mexico.",Gary R,"June 23, 2018",True

Checked thermostat with a hair dryer and ice harvested (melted ice enough to be pushed into the bucket, thermostat was working but mold was not heating). Disassembled the icemaker, checked aluminastic was covering thermostat. Then slightly bent pins on motor plug for positive contact with wiring harness. Over next two days the ice mold heated and the infrared switch lights indicated harvesting mode but ice extraction arm would not rotate to push ice out of mold. I replugged the refrigerator several times during the two days and finally everything was working normal the morning of the third day. I surmised using the hairdryer got things out of sync.

PS11700870,dd51a35f853a4cf3,5,Exactly what was needed.,"Started to get a little bit of water leaking from the lower section of the washer unit during cycles. Upon inspection, noted that the lower gasket looked frayed right where the wheels of the lower basket roll out on. Which means of course it will eventually do it again, but hopefully not anytime soon. Installation of this new gasket solved the leak right away. There's a little work to install it, but nothing too major. Just have to detach the door at the hinges, and disconnect the tension cables from the door (easy). Slide the old gasket out (may take some pulling), and then slide the new one in its place. Be sure to install it in the same orientation that the old one was. It's not difficult to see which way is which. Reverse the steps to reattach the door, and done. NOTE: THIS GASKET 100% FITS GE MODEL GDF520PSD0SS",Joey C,"February 1, 2025",True

PS11748543,2143760a0779661c,5,easy repair and cheap fix,As other reviews mentioned this part solved the majority of the leak. I was getting a little leak along the door rubber due to the door being slightly warped from bent hinges and door opening all the way to the floor. I am planning to remodel and replace the unit in the near future so I did not want to spend the $120 so I flipped the rubber over and it created a tight seal. It seems sense the door only makes contact to the rubber on a thin center line so the edges were still thick and firm enough to make a seal.

Because the US Postal Service had been having issues and was also slammed with holiday packages, I wanted to make sure that the shipping I selected was either FedEx or UPS.

PS11748543,2143760a0779661c,5,easy repair and cheap fix,As other reviews mentioned this part solved the majority of the leak. I was getting a little leak along the door rubber due to the door being slightly warped from bent hinges and door opening all the way to the floor. I am planning to remodel and replace the unit in the near future so I did not want to spend the $120 so I flipped the rubber over and it created a tight seal. It seems sense the door only makes contact to the rubber on a thin center line so the edges were still thick and firm enough to make a seal.

The trouble is the hose it was designed to replace is 27 inches. The inch and a half shortage doesn't allow for the ends to go all the way on the inlet ends and even if you try just putting them on half way it still forces the hose to flatten around the lower ""bend"" which would cut off the water from getting any further up the hose. To have this hose not the exact same length is ridiculous.

The trouble is the hose it was designed to replace is 27 inches. The inch and a half shortage doesn't allow for the ends to go all the way on the inlet ends and even if you try just putting them on half way it still forces the hose to flatten around the lower ""bend"" which would cut off the water from getting any further up the hose. To have this hose not the exact same length is ridiculous. Unless this hose was just a miscut that didn't get caught by quality control and you check to measure a new one for the correct length , Frigidaire needs to correct this issue.

PS11750057,cedad0137ad09ca8,5,"For a person who knows next to nothing about repair, this was a super easy fix!","First, it should be noted that my repair knowledge is/was minimal prior to ordering these wheels. Now, a piece of advice from a novice: Take the extra few seconds to plug your model number in at the start to avoid ordering the wrong items and shipping things back. Yup ... did that because ""Of course I know which part I needed"" ... I didn't. Thankfully the customer service people are phenomenal and helped fix my confusion, aka teach me to read the suggestion of putting in my model number before ordering. As far as ordering and replacement goes, a suggestion from me. If your wheel(s) wore out naturally and you are thinking of ordering 1 of these ... DON'T. Save yourself the shipping costs and order 4 of these from the get-go. Disregard if it isn't general wear that caused your wheel to fail. Best practice in removal of the old wheel (to prevent you from injuring your hand ... like me ....) use a flathead screwdriver or other punch type tool and a hammer or mallet to break off the 2 locking buttons holding the wheel in place. Attempting to pry them back, while pushing the wheel casing out was a bit of a failure on my part. When putting the new wheels in, it was as simple as just snapping them in place and done. The wheels work wonderfully!",Eric L,"June 5, 2023",True

Make sure to have a careful grasp of the ring, or you will have to fish it out of the cess pit at the bottom of the machine.)

The latch came and nothing happened. I finally decided to try the fuse and, bam turned on. The only thing that tripped me up was pushing the metal tab out of the black plastic block.

Both worked fine, were easy to do, and the video instructions were helpful. The Lower door seal REQUIRES the silicon glue stuff - or the seal won't stay in place. I did not use the two overflow cups...and their replacement would have been much more work. (remove the door and potentially have to pull the dishwasher out of the cabinet to reach the door springs.) The bottom line: everything worked and my dishwasher is now usable. The bad part? These seals were incredibly expensive. The markup had to be at least 1000%...and I'm not exaggerating. I'm sure I needed about 30"" of gasket, and they wheeled 30"" off of a spool, cut it, and stuck it in a bag and mailed it to me. Their cost couldn't have been $4...and I paid almost $70.

It seems they've applied a liquid thread locking compound to the threaded part of the element. the material was applied much too thick and would not allow the nuts that retain the element and seal the rubber washer to thread onto the element stem. I had to re-thread the element stem to remove the red thread locking compound and subsequently re-thread the plastic retaining nuts to match. I was then able to install the element, however this made the process considerably difficult and frustrating.

PS16221213,b5a5275657935c79,5,worked as expected,"I was able to receive a drain pump for my Maytag Dishwasher after getting a code that it was not working and could not get the washer to drain. The installation was very quick once I resolved that none of the drain lines were plugged and I had localized the problem. The unit can be easily replaced by disconnecting power, and pulling out the dishwasher from the counter. The insulation will have to be set aside for later use and the insulation near the pump pulled back to expose the assembly. By tipping the machine on its side the pump can be clearly seen. Taking the new pump, I removed the power source and immediately attached to the new pump. I then twisted the old pump out from its seating, and notices that one blade in the pump had broken and jammed the existing unit. Taking out the small piece of metal, I when again checked hoses to be sure no blockage and tightened new pump into place, The process only takes a few minutes if this is the problem. After install, put back the insulation covering the pump assembly and upright the machine. Then replace insulation cover and slide back into counter. Once in place connect the power and it should run fine. We had no error code once the machine was turned on. Hope this helps a bit if you have a similar issue. Be sure to check all your hoses prior to replacement as this is a more common problem.",John B,"November 17, 2021",True

Upon closer inspection the leak was originating from inside and small bubbles were flowing down the inside of the float switch tube out the bottom.

This was a huge find or I would have had to replace an otherwise perfectly functional awesome dishwasher. I got the OEM part. It came a day earlier than expected. The part itself was easy to put on the dishwasher. But, if you have ever installed a dishwasher, all those steps were needed as well. Disconnecting from the disposal under the sink, and mine was hard wired so needed to kill the breaker and disconnect the wires and then reinstall everything.

I read some of the reviews and comments and gleaned a good deal of diagnostic information from the site. Since the old touch pad was in very bad shape and only one light would still work, I suspected this was the main problem. So I ordered a new touch pad, and for good measure, a new thermal control switch; total expenditure $160. The parts arrived a couple of days later, I disassembled the touch pad and replaced both parts. The machine fired right up, thus saving me about $600 more dollars for a new machine.

However, i think my real problem pertains to the inner door. I seems that the top of the inner door has a bend. Didn’t notice that until after pulling apart the door and trying to make the Bezel & CVR fit—UGH. Video shows the Bezel & CVR snapping right in. Not so for me. After wrestling with this part of the task, i noticed all of the tabs were steered. I used a few words that my wife didn’t know i had in my vocabulary and i think that some of those may have been made up by me as frustrations arrived.

This part may have been defective preventing proper install. The plastic clips would not clip into place and after many attempts one of clips broke off. The cover has been installed but because of the broken clip it is not is not clipped in place and is loose. The Technician said that since I ordered the part he cannot warrantee it and he will have to order a replacement part and return to install it.
